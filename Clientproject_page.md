## Client Project

[Find the project here.](/pdf/ComputerScienceNEA.pdf)

**Project description:** 

As part of my final year A-Level computer science assessment I was given the opportunity to develop my practical skills in the context of solving a realistic problem or carrying out and investigation. Working independently, I was able to extend my programming skills and deepen my understanding of computer science.

In the non-examination assessment (NEA) I could choose between:
• Finding a solution to a problem.
This meant selecting a problem and developing a system to solve it. Typically, the solution
would be developed for a third party with an end user. 
• An investigation.
This meant selecting an area of the subject that they are interested in and conducting an
investigation of this area, with the focus being on programming.


I selected a problem-based project as I was inexperienced at working with a third party and wanted to develop my communcation, inference and independent programming skills.
The task I chose was creating a new system for a client (the IT manager at my college) that would improve on the current computer room booking system. I also used this opportunity to work with a database in a realistic setting.

In addition to the final solution, this project was formed of four main sections. 

### 1. Analysis
Analysis involved conducting research, communicating with my client, prototyping and identifying methods and sources required. Working through this section enabled me to gain a deep understanding of the problem, allowing me to identify the objectives for the project and giving a clear direction for my design and solution development. 

### 2. Documented Design
The documented design consisted of sequencing the final solution, by creating structure charts, flowcharts and data flow diagrams for my system. Furthermore, I documented key algorithms, data structures, file organisation and database design. The importance of design was to assist me in producing a working, efficient solution to the problem and to enable maintenance of the system at a later date.

### 3. Testing
Testing helped demonstrate if I have achieved the objectives identified in the analysis. I was required to produce a test plan, then complete each step, providing evidence and stating the end result. I was also able to show an example of the system in use, however the account used the to produce the evidence was closed as it was part of my college.

### 4. Evaluation
Evaluation allowed me to reflect on the success of the project in meeting the objectives identified in the analysis. I was also able to reflect on feedback from the client and discuss potential improvements and extensions to the solution. For each objective I explained how I could implement the possible improvements and gave an overview of the effectiveness of it within my solution.
