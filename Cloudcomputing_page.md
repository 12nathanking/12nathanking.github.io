### Project description:

As part of my final year university assessment I was involved in a group study to investigate the potential impacts of cloud computing implementation within our education. We were tasked with conducting research to produce a document with our findings and a recommendation for the University. We were able to work as part of a team under the tutorage of an expert in our chosen field in preparation for future employability.

Our study involved researching the different methods available and reviewing services provided by the University. Whilst collaborating with other students we had to opportunity to present our findings to a group of clients, lecturers and students. Throughout the investigation we ran surveys with both CEMPS students and staff members to understand the University’s needs. We also looked into and trialled cloud services, including Microsoft Teams, GitLab and Azure Lab Services. In order to give a well rounded recommendation we also researched the costs of these services and compared this to the University’s present outlays.

The project gave me an opportunity to understand how to approach a large-scale investigation, as I was required to perform an extensive analysis to ensure a successful report. This included creating a critical path and methodology to meet frequent deadlines and expectations of my team.

### My Responsibilites
Throughout the project I ran the trial group aimed at obtaining experience feedback from students who had just used Azure Lab Services. For this I acquired an active license from the IT team, set up the classroom lab containing virtual machines specifically designed for our task, created effective question sheets on coding, organised a number of students in a suitable computer lab to carry out the test. In addition, I managed the section on Microsoft Teams, acquiring the active license from IT team and running communications when an issue occurred. Another responsibility I had was managing the output of the report, including all the Microsoft Teams and Azure lab services sections as well as the conclusion, editing and proof reading. I also contributed by organising meetings and delivered an update presentation in front of an audience, aimed to inform interested parties.

### Skills Development
After working in a team I developed my ability to effectively work in a group of new people and share ideas productively. Through the use of the software Azure Lab Services and Microsoft Teams I was able to develop my ability to use and learn new online software. I also learnt how to use LaTeX, which was used for collaborative work to create the report. From communications with James Bingham (IT team), I learnt how to professionally communicate to staff following technical issues. Furthermore, I developed my time management skills as I created a project plan to follow deadlines and attended weekly meetings. I also extended my public speaking and formal writing abilities as I had to give presentations and write a large-scale report.
